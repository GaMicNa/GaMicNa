## Career Objectives
My name is Gaid Michael Navia Lara. I am lifelong learner and passionate about the environment and data science, with profesional experience managing environmental databases. Thanks to my B.S. I received solid training in statistics. I am proficient in Phyton, SQL,  Tableau and Power BI, which have enabled me to carry out various data-driven projects successfully, as can be seen in my portfolio. I am interested in working with large datasets, including cleaning, connecting and mining data.
Currently, I’m looking to further improve my skills in artificial intelligence and plan to pursue a master’s degree in this field.
