Currently there is a serious problem of shortage of dollars, gas and increased food prices in Bolivia. Since crises are a recurring phenomenon in this country, it forces me to consider the scenario of knowing if there are similar economic and social precedents to be able to take measures in this regard.
For this purpose, data provided by the World Bank was utilized, and machine learning techniques were applied to classify years that shared common economic and social patterns. The importance of this analysis lies in understanding how recurring economic events and implemented policies have impacted the Bolivian economy over time. Techniques such as K-means, Agglomerative Clustering, and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) were employed to create groups of years that exhibited similar behaviors.

This project models the operations of a salte√±as (***very delicius and bolivian traditional morning brunch***) factory using an Entity-Relationship Diagram, considering entities such as orders, branches, ingredients, employee shifts, and more. The goal is to analyze the data to propose improvements in operational efficiency and increase profit margins.
