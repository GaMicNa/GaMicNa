## üíº Experience
### ENDE, Corp.
***Database manager - Line Consultant***

*October 2018 - June 2024, Cochabamba, Bol*
As a member of the hydrological and hydrometric research team at the National Electricity Company, I led the water and sediment quality unit. By making data-driven decisions, I reduced data collection costs by 65% and doubled team productivity through the systematization of data storage processes.
-	Analyzed the consistency and coherence of 12 types of hydrological data collected from 43 monitoring sites at 5-minute intervals, enabling data-driven decisions for the maintenance and calibration of stations. 
-	Supported the analysis of hydrological and hydraulic modeling by evaluating the existing dataset and applying machine learning techniques to identify the most critical parameters for assessing water quality. This process led to a 70% reduction in the number of parameters required for laboratory analysis, significantly cutting costs and enhancing the efficiency of water quality evaluations.
-	Systematized the water quality database and developed a dashboard that synthesized the behavior of water quality indicators and sampling frequencies. This innovation allowed for up to a 200% increase in data collection frequency in under-sampled areas, significantly improving data coverage and the accuracy of environmental monitoring.
-	Standardized field sampling procedures, resulting in a 100% increase in the accuracy of data collected. This improvement ensured higher data reliability and consistency, which enhanced the quality of subsequent analyses and environmental assessments.
-	Streamlined the water levels database by implementing thorough cleaning, standardization, and administration processes, reducing the time required for analysis and report generation by 50%.
-	Designed and created the water and sediment quality database from the ground up, compiling, systematizing, and analyzing data. This foundational work enabled efficient data management and ongoing analysis, ensuring data integrity and improving the accuracy of environmental assessments.
-	Trained and expanded the technical data collection team to 12 employees, enhancing operational capacity and ensuring adherence to best practices in water quality monitoring.
-	Developed and implemented water quality data collection protocols, ensuring consistency and accuracy in field operations, which improved data reliability across campaigns.
- Relevant Technology/Area used:
PostgreSQL
Python
RStudio
ArcGis
PowerBi
Microsoft Access
Microsoft Excel
